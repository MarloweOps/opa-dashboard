# Acid Media — Brand Positioning Document
*Prepared by Heywood / The Varied — Confidential Working Draft*

---

## 1. Brand Story

Acid Media didn't start as a strategy. It started as a name that felt right — and names that feel right usually do so for a reason. Nick built it the first time around because he saw production companies playing it safe, making work that looked expensive and meant nothing. The name said everything: corrosive, mind-altering, not for everyone. That company had the instinct. Now it has the infrastructure.

The relaunch isn't a nostalgia play. It's a bet. Nick brings what he always had — relationships, EP credibility, and the kind of reputation that gets calls returned. Brendan brings what the first version lacked: production operations precision, an AI-augmented workflow built through The Varied's OPA system, and the organizational discipline to scale what Nick can sell. Two founders, both with Boston in their blood, operating in an LA market that rewards the right kind of outsider energy — people who know how to work, not just how to pitch.

What this company is really about: making work that earns its audience. Not chasing trends. Not pitching concepts that die in committee. Getting in the room with brands and artists who have something to say and helping them say it on film, with craft, without apology. Acid Media exists because there's still a gap between "real production" and "real edge" — and that gap is where the best work lives.

---

## 2. Positioning Statement

Acid Media is a full-service production company for brands and artists who want work that actually means something — built on professional rigor, indie instinct, and zero tolerance for safe.

---

## 3. The Wedge

Most production companies make one of two mistakes: they're too polished (glossy, agency-dependent, interchangeable) or they're too precious about being "indie" (lo-fi by accident, not by choice). The real gap in the LA market right now is a company that operates at the professional level — legit crew, real budgets, proper post — but communicates and positions itself like a creative force rather than a vendor.

Acid Media's wedge is **craft-with-conviction**: the ability to deliver at a commercial standard *and* bring a genuine point of view. Most directors and EPs have one or the other. Few have both, and fewer still have built it into a company identity.

Secondary wedge: **direct-to-brand relationships**. The agency layer is thinning. Brands are building in-house creative teams, labels are managing artist content more directly, and the production companies that build trust with the actual decision-makers — not their intermediaries — will own the next decade. Acid Media is structured to go direct and stay direct.

## 4. Target Client Profile (ICP)

**The Acid Media client is not a brand. It's a person.**

**Primary ICP — Brand-Side:**
The VP or Head of Creative at a challenger brand with $5M–$50M in marketing spend. They came up in creative, not business school. They've sat through too many production pitches from companies that showed them the same reel. They have strong opinions about what their brand *isn't* — and a harder time articulating what it *is*. They want a production partner who pushes back, not a vendor who says yes. They'll spend on quality if they trust you. They've probably referenced Liquid Death internally at least once. Age: 28–42. They have a tattoo or they wish they did.

**Secondary ICP — Music/Label-Side:**
The A&R or artist manager at an independent or mid-major label with an artist who's crossing over. They're working with an act that has cultural heat but hasn't cracked the video side yet. They need someone who understands music — not just visually but culturally — and can translate a sound into a world. They're skeptical of LA production companies that charge $150K for a video that looks like a car commercial. Budget range: $30K–$200K. They care about the director relationship, not the company name.

**Tertiary ICP — Direct Artist:**
The established artist or band managing their own creative output. Tired of label interference, or independent entirely. Has budget ($20K–$80K), has taste, and needs execution. Will refer heavily if the experience is right.

## 5. Competitive Landscape

**Serial Pictures** — Mid-to-high-end commercial and music video production. Professional, well-resourced, strong roster. Where Acid Media wins: Serial is a machine. Acid Media is a perspective. Clients who want a collaborator, not a pipeline, will feel the difference.

**Caviar** — International boutique with strong director relationships, known for stylized work. Aspirational comp. Where Acid Media wins: Caviar is positioned upmarket and European in sensibility. Acid Media is grittier, more American, more accessible for mid-budget clients who need edge without the day rate.

**Pulse Films** — Music-forward, documentary DNA, genuine indie credibility. Probably the closest spiritual comp. Where Acid Media wins: Pulse is London-rooted. Acid Media is LA-native with direct access to the US market, particularly hip-hop and street-culture clients. Also: Pulse is big enough to feel corporate. Acid Media is small enough to mean it.

**Smuggler** — Legacy shop with serious creative pedigree. Where Acid Media wins: Smuggler is a destination for top-tier directors. Acid Media is a destination for top-tier *work* — the distinction matters when you're not yet staffing A-list directors. Clients come to Acid Media for the company's point of view, not just who's on the roster.

## 6. Brand Personality & Voice

**Five Traits:**

1. **Unvarnished** — We say what we think. Our pitches don't hide the hard part. We'll tell a client their idea isn't working.
2. **Technically Credible** — We know what we're doing. We don't romanticize chaos; we choose our imperfections deliberately.
3. **Street-Smart** — We move in multiple worlds. Hip-hop, punk, commercial, art — not tourists in any of them.
4. **Low-Ego, High-Standards** — Not here to win awards. Here to make the work right.
5. **Irreverent-but-Earned** — We can be funny, weird, provocative. But it comes from somewhere. Never edgy for the sake of it.

**What Acid Media sounds like:**
A director who's done 200 shoots explaining why they'd do this one differently. Confident. Specific. Not impressed by your budget, very impressed by your brief.

**What it never sounds like:**
A production company website. Agency-speak. "Storytelling" used as a noun. "Passion." "Obsessed." "Elevate your brand." Corporate enthusiasm. Performed humility.

**Words we use:**
Craft. Rigor. Real. Frame. Texture. Instinct. Direct. Sharp. Clean (when earned). Earned. Specific. Considered.

**Words we ban:**
Storytelling (unless literal). Elevate. Disrupt. Passionate. Unique. Dynamic. Cinematic (overused). Journey. Authentic (the fakest word in marketing). World-class. Best-in-class. Any word ending in "-ize" used as strategy.

---

## 7. Visual Direction

**The Aesthetic:**

Acid Media's visual world lives at the intersection of **analog warmth and urban tension**. Think: the texture of Super 8 on a 4K budget. The color palette of a 1977 parking garage. The framing of someone who studied photography before they studied film.

**Reference Points:**

- **(Films)** The Friends of Eddie Coyle. Kids. City of God. Early Harmony Korine. The Fits. Short Term 12. The first 20 minutes of Uncut Gems. Anything shot by Rodrigo Prieto when he's not trying.
- **(Photography)** Larry Clark. Nan Goldin. Gordon Parks. Boogie. Ricky Powell for the hip-hop side.
- **(Music Videos)** Hiro Murai's early Childish Gambino work. Director X's Drake videos before Drake got soft. Any Kendrick video that felt like a short film.
- **(Brands)** Liquid Death (the north star). New Balance's recent creative. Carhartt WIP. Patagonia's activism content (the grit, not the granola).
- **(Era feel)** 1992–2002 as a reference, not a recreation.

**What the reel should feel like:**
You just watched 10 things that feel completely different from each other — different artists, different brands, different budgets — but all clearly made by people who gave a damn. There's a mood that runs through it. Lived-in. Purposeful. Nothing is glossy for gloss's sake.

**What it should never look like:**
Stock-adjacent. The "moody but safe" aesthetic that every boutique production company defaults to. Blue-teal-orange. Anamorphic lens flares used as personality. Drone shots of warehouses. Couples walking in slow motion. Any visual that could appear in a tech startup's "culture" video.

## 8. Services & Offerings

*Listed in order of differentiation, not revenue size.*

**1. Music Video Production**
The foundation. Nick's relationships, Brendan's operations, and the company's aesthetic DNA live here most naturally. Full-service: concept development, director attachment, crew, production, post. Budget range to be defined, but the sweet spot is probably $40K–$300K. This is where Acid Media builds its portfolio and its reputation.

**2. Commercial + Branded Content**
The revenue engine. Challenger brands, direct-to-brand where possible. Ability to develop the brief, not just execute it. This is where the AI-augmented workflow (OPA) delivers a real cost advantage — faster pre-production, tighter scheduling, more time and money on set.

**3. Director Development**
*[Note: Uncertain whether this is a launch offering or a Phase 2 play — name it, don't paper over it.]* The model where Acid Media develops emerging directors under its banner. Right aesthetic, early career, willing to grow within the company's point of view. Builds the roster that becomes the calling card.

**4. Short-Form Content / Social Campaign Production**
Brands need volume. Acid Media can produce it without sacrificing quality. The key differentiator here is that Acid Media treats social content like a smaller version of the real thing — not a cheaper version.

**5. Creative Development + Treatment Writing**
Pre-production creative consulting. Some clients need help getting to a brief that's worth shooting. Acid Media can be paid for this thinking before a production deal is signed. *[Revenue-light but relationship-building — useful for converting long-term clients.]*

## 9. The Acid Media Pitch

*What you'd say at dinner when someone asks what you do:*

"We're a production company — we do commercials and music videos, mostly. But the way we think about it is: there are a lot of companies in LA that can execute your concept, and there are a lot that will tell you they have taste. We're trying to be the one that actually does both — where the production rigor is real and the creative instinct is real. We work with brands and artists who have something to say and want it to look like it means something. We're not for everyone. We don't try to be."

## 10. Client Tier Strategy

**Tier 1 — Warm / Reachable Now**
These are clients accessible through Nick's existing relationships or warm intros, or brands already in Brendan's production network.

- Cash Money Records and affiliated artists (Nick's existing label relationships)
- Mid-major hip-hop labels with active rosters (A&R relationships, direct outreach)
- Emerging challenger CPG brands in the $10M–$50M revenue range (direct-to-brand)
- Independent artists with marketing budget ($20K–$80K video budgets)
- Music supervisors and creative directors at streetwear brands (New Balance, Carhartt adjacents)
- Boston-market brands and regional companies (potential geographic differentiator — less competition, deeper trust)

**Tier 2 — Mid-Term (6–18 months)**
Requires portfolio proof, a few wins, and the reel to back it up.

- Liquid Death (the north star — not unreachable, just needs the right entry point and the right work to show them first)
- Def Jam, Interscope, Atlantic (larger label video budgets)
- Cannabis brands with national presence (High aesthetics, punk adjacency, growing budgets)
- Action sports / lifestyle brands: Red Bull, Monster, Vans
- Direct-to-consumer brands with strong brand identity and willingness to take creative risk

**Tier 3 — Aspirational (2–3 years)**
These are the names that appear on the reel that changes everything.

- Liquid Death (Yes, also in Tier 2 — the difference is budget scale and campaign scope)
- Nike / Jordan Brand (independent creative agencies are increasingly going direct)
- Major artist campaigns: the Kendricks, the Tylers, the artists where the video matters
- Streaming platforms (Netflix, Apple TV+) for short-form creative content
- Award show / festival appearances that validate the creative brand

## 11. What Makes This Defensible

**Why Acid Media exists in 5 years:**

The moat is not the reel. Reels can be replicated. The moat is the combination of things that are hard to copy at once:

1. **The name.** Acid Media is a brand asset, not a descriptor. It has memory, ambiguity, and edge. You can't rebrand your way into having a name like that — you either have it or you don't.

2. **The operator advantage.** Brendan's OPA-augmented production workflow means Acid Media can produce cleaner, faster, and with fewer expensive surprises than comparably-sized competitors. That's a cost structure advantage that compounds over time — lower overhead = ability to take risks on creative briefs that other companies can't afford to say yes to.

3. **The direct-to-brand positioning.** As agencies continue to lose ground, production companies that have built direct client relationships will have structural pricing power. Acid Media is positioning for this now, not reacting to it later.

4. **Cultural credibility that's earned, not performed.** This is the hardest thing to build and the easiest to lose. If the first 10 pieces of work are right — if they actually represent the aesthetic and values in this document — then the company has something real. Credibility in this space is referential: one right client leads to three others.

5. **The partnership structure.** Nick's relationships + Brendan's operations is a rare combination. Most indie production companies are either EP-heavy (can sell but can't manage) or ops-heavy (can manage but can't get in the room). The two-partner model, if it functions well, is a genuine structural advantage.
