## ⚡ DECISIONS MADE (flag if you disagree)

| Decision | What I did | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Title | "Founder" not "Founder & CEO" | CEO on a solo-founder SaaS reads as compensating. "Founder" is cleaner and more confident. You can add CEO later when it means something. |
| Headline | Removed "Former" | You're currently line producing. "Former" is inaccurate and undersells the dual identity. |
| Company for LP/Director work | "The Varied" | Honest umbrella. Broken Compass stays off the page entirely. |
| OPA start date | [2025] placeholder | Confirm the month you actually started building. |
| LP start date | [Early 2025] | Per your note that you started last year. Confirm. |
| Acid Media | Not mentioned | Per your instruction. |

## HEADLINE
**Paste this exactly:**

```
Founder, OPA — Building the production office that runs itself | Line Producer & Creative Director
```

_Note: "Line Producer & Creative Director" stays without "Former" because you're actively doing both. It reads as range, not history._

---

## ABOUT SECTION
**Paste this exactly:**

```
I worked in production for a long time. PA, coordinator, line producer, creative director — the whole ladder.

Somewhere along the way I started building the thing I wished I'd had from the beginning.

OPA is a production office assistant. Not a "platform." Not a "solution." It's a tool for the people who are actually running the show — the ones drowning in call sheets, deal memos, vendor comps, and 47 unanswered emails about parking. It handles the operational side so you can do the work that actually needs a brain.

I'm building it because I've been the guy tracking $2M in spend across 14 browser tabs. I've been the guy at 6am staring at a wrap report where something doesn't add up and nobody's awake yet.

Production people don't need another app to learn. They need something that works the way they already work.

If you're in production and any of that sounds familiar, I'd genuinely love to hear from you.
If you build software and want to make tools for creative industries, same deal.
```

_Small change from Heywood's draft: added "coordinator" to the ladder — it fills the gap between PA and LP and shows you know the coordinator role intimately (which is OPA's primary user). Worth keeping._

## EXPERIENCE SECTION

### Role 1 — CURRENT
**Title:** Founder
**Company:** OPA (Production Office Assistant)
**Dates:** [2025] – Present
**Location:** Los Angeles, CA

**Description:**
```
Building production operations software for the people who actually run the show.

OPA handles the admin layer — expense tracking, vendor reconciliation, crew documents, budget management — so production coordinators and line producers can stop firefighting and start producing.

Built by someone who's done the job. That part matters.

Currently: early users, active development, building in public.
```

_Note: "Currently: early users, active development, building in public." — this is honest and signals momentum without overclaiming. If it feels too raw, cut the last line. But I'd keep it. It's founder energy, not startup-speak._

---

### Role 2 — LINE PRODUCER
**Title:** Line Producer
**Company:** The Varied / Freelance
**Dates:** [Early 2025] – Present
**Location:** Los Angeles, CA

**Description (add this at the end of your existing description):**
```
This is the job OPA is built for. Everything I know about what coordinators and line producers actually need — the real friction, the daily firefighting, the 6am wrap math — I know because I'm doing it.
```

_If your existing description is thin or outdated, here's a full replacement option:_
```
Commercial and branded content line producing. Budget management, crew coordination, vendor relationships, location logistics — the operational layer that makes a production run.

Clients have included brands in automotive, tech, food & beverage, and streaming. [Add specific brands you're comfortable naming here — BTS, Netflix-adjacent, Toyota, etc.]

This is the job OPA is built for. The friction is real, the inefficiencies are real, and that's exactly why I started building the tool.
```

---

### Role 3 — CREATIVE DIRECTOR / DIRECTOR
**Title:** Creative Director & Director
**Company:** The Varied
**Dates:** [YEAR] – Present
**Location:** Los Angeles, CA

**Description (add this at the end of your existing description, or use as full replacement):**
```
Directing and creative direction across commercial, branded content, and music video. Clients include [brands you're comfortable listing].

Directing is where I first saw the gap clearly — between the creative side and the operational reality holding it together. Every production made it more obvious that the back office was running on duct tape and goodwill.

That observation turned into OPA.
```

---

### Role 4 — EARLIER PRODUCTION ROLES
**For PA / Coordinator / Producer / early roles:**

Add one line to each, something like:

```
Came up through the ranks. This is where the muscle memory comes from.
```

Or role-specific:
- **Coordinator:** "The coordinator role is the one I built OPA around. I know exactly why the job is broken."
- **PA:** "Where I learned what good production looks like from the ground up."
- **Producer:** "Scaled up from here. Each step added a layer to what eventually became OPA."

_Keep early roles SHORT. One sentence each. They're proof of ladder, not biography._

## FEATURED SECTION

**Pin in this order:**

1. **useopa.com** — first slot, no negotiation. Link, clean description: "OPA — production operations software for commercial production."
2. **The origin post** — The "I was a line producer and I got tired of how broken the back office is" post. This doesn't exist yet. Should be post #1 of the new content strategy. Pin it the day you publish it.
3. **One production insight post** — Something a coordinator reads and thinks "this person gets it." Budget math, wrap report reality, how a call sheet becomes chaos. Exists in the content pipeline — surface the best one.

_Featured section is currently a conversion asset. Don't pin anything that doesn't serve one of the three audiences (production people, collaborators, peers)._

## BANNER IMAGE

**What to build:**
- Dark background (match OPA: `#0D1B2A` Ink or `#0d3a0b` Forest Dark)
- Text only: `OPA` large, then `Production Office Assistant` small below
- Optional: `app.useopa.com` in small mono type bottom right
- No headshot. No stock photo. No cityscape.

**Dimensions:** 1584 × 396px (LinkedIn standard)

_I can generate this spec for a designer or attempt it in code. Flag when you want it._

## SKILLS — FINAL LIST

**Keep these (paste exactly):**
- Production Management
- Line Producing
- Commercial Production
- Budgeting
- Content Production
- Product Development
- Film Production
- Music Video Production
- Creative Direction

**Add these (new):**
- Product Management
- SaaS

**Remove anything:**
- "Leadership"
- "Team Management"
- "Communication"
- "Problem Solving"
- Anything that reads like a resume keyword, not a real skill

_Note: Dropping "AI / Machine Learning" from the original plan. You're not an ML engineer and production people will clock it as positioning. "SaaS" and "Product Development" signal the shift cleanly without overclaiming._

---

## POSTING STRATEGY (locked in)

- **2–3x/week**
- **Mix:** 60% production ops insights / war stories, 30% building OPA in public, 10% industry takes
- **Voice:** First person. Honest. Occasionally funny. If it sounds like a LinkedIn post, rewrite it.
- **Rule:** No post goes up that you wouldn't say out loud at a production dinner
- **Engagement:** Comment on coordinators, PMs, LPs. Be a person in their feed, not a brand

_The content pipeline (Heywood) is ready. The profile just needs to be the foundation it lands on._

---

## WHAT NOT TO DO (non-negotiable)

- No "AI Enthusiast" — anywhere
- No "disrupting" — anywhere
- No "passionate about" — anywhere
- No complete filmography — curate
- No connect-spam
- Don't turn on Creator Mode until you're committing to weekly

---

## IMPLEMENTATION ORDER (copy this list)

- [ ] Upload headshot (`-39.jpg`)
- [ ] Paste headline
- [ ] Paste About section
- [ ] Update OPA experience entry (new role, copy from above)
- [ ] Update Line Producer entry (add forward-pointer line)
- [ ] Update Creative Director entry (add forward-pointer line, swap company to The Varied)
- [ ] Trim early roles to one line each
- [ ] Clean up skills (remove fluff, add Product Development + SaaS)
- [ ] Build + upload banner image
- [ ] Pin Featured section (useopa.com first)
- [ ] Write + publish origin post → pin it

**Estimated time: ~60–90 minutes if you do it in one sitting.**

---

## ONE FLAG

The OPA role description says "Currently: early users, active development, building in public." That's honest. But if 7 users feels too thin to mention publicly, cut it. The rest of the description stands without it.

Everything else in this document I'm confident in. No fluff added. Nothing overclaimed.
